# Forex Robot Dude

Forex Robot Dude is an automated trading software developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to trade in the forex market based on predefined parameters and price movements.

## Input Parameters

- **Period**: Pre-set period for monitoring price fluctuations.
- **EntryThreshold**: Price movement threshold for trade execution.
- **TakeProfit**: Pre-defined take profit in pips.
- **StopLoss**: Pre-defined stop loss in pips.

## Trading Function

The `Trade()` function is responsible for executing trades based on the defined parameters. It checks if entry is allowed and if price movements surpass the entry threshold. If the conditions are met, it executes a buy trade with the specified lot size, stop loss, and take profit.

If the trade is successful, it increments the order count and adjusts the lot size for subsequent entries if lot size adjustment is enabled. The lot size is calculated based on the account balance and is set for all subsequent orders.

## Start Function

The `OnStart()` function is called when the program starts. It sets the pre-set period for monitoring price fluctuations and enables the entry logic during that period. It then calls the `Trade()` function to execute trades.

## Deinit Function

The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the program is stopped or removed. It prints the total number of orders executed during the trading session.
